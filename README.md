## Running on the Raspberry Pi

The IMU-driven PID loop now lives in `main.py`. Launch it with:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Key environment variables you can tune (and set in the systemd service):

- `LOOP_HZ`, `KP`, `KI`, `KD`, `MAX_TILT_DEG` – PID gains and outer tilt clamp.
- `AXIS_ROT_DEG`, `INVERT_PITCH`, `INVERT_ROLL` – align the IMU frame with the servo geometry if you aren’t using calibration vectors.
- `PITCH_OFFSET`, `ROLL_OFFSET` – remove static bias from the IMU readings.
- `CAL_A`, `CAL_B`, `CAL_C` – provide measured `(pitch,roll)` readings (comma-separated) for each servo direction; the code solves for the best 2×2 transform to align the axes. Override the targets with `CAL_*_TARGET_DEG` if your servo layout differs.
- `PITCH_ALPHA`, `ROLL_ALPHA` – per-axis complementary filter weighting; lower values trust the accelerometer more.
- `OUTPUT_EMA_ALPHA` – optional smoothing factor (0–1) applied to the PID corrections before converting to servo angles (higher values smooth more).
- `OUTPUT_DEADBAND` – treat small PID outputs (|value| below this threshold) as zero to reduce jitter around neutral.
- `DEBUG=1` – prints raw vs rotated IMU values, PID corrections, and commanded spherical angles for live tuning.

### Motor Angle Calibration
Each of the three motors must be calibrated. Follow these exact steps:

1. **Set all motor offsets to `0`.**  
   In `controller.py`, inside the `set_motor_angles` function under class `RobotController`, make sure it looks like this:  
   ```python
   self.s1.angle = clamp(theta1)
   self.s2.angle = clamp(theta2)
   self.s3.angle = clamp(theta3)
    ```
2. **Initialize the robot.**  
   Power on the robot. Then, in your terminal (in correct directory), run:  
   `python controller.py`  
   This sets the initial motor positions. Once the robot has reached its position, **do not touch it**. Power it off, then use a level or measurement tool to check how flat the top plate is.

3. **Tune each motor's angle offset.**  
   Based on how the plate is tilted, adjust each motor's angle by adding or subtracting an offset. Modify the code like this:
   ```python
   self.s1.angle = clamp(theta1) + OFFSET_S1
   self.s2.angle = clamp(theta2) + OFFSET_S2
   self.s3.angle = clamp(theta3) + OFFSET_S3
   ```
   Replace each `OFFSET_Sn` with the value needed to make the plate level. These values are specific to your hardware and may differ for each motor.

4. **Iterate until balanced.**  
   Repeat steps 2 and 3. Re-run the controller, check the plate, and adjust the offsets as needed. Continue this process until the top plate is completely flat and stable.
